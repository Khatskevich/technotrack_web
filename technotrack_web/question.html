                        How to build a moon park?
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        The Moon (in Greek: σελήνη Selene, in Latin: Luna) is Earth's only natural satellite.[e][9] It
                        is one of the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, and, among planetary satellites,
                        the largest relative to the size of the planet it orbits (its primary).[f][g] It is the
                        second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known (after Jupiter's satellite Io).
                        <br>
                        The Moon is thought to have formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, not long after Earth.
                        There are several hypotheses for its origin; the most widely accepted explanation is that the
                        Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body
                        called Theia.
                        <br>
                        The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face with its near side
                        marked by dark volcanic maria that fill between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the
                        prominent impact craters. It is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in
                        Earth's sky (after the Sun), as measured by illuminance on Earth's surface. Although it can
                        appear a very bright white, its surface is actually dark, with a reflectance just slightly
                        higher than that of worn asphalt. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases
                        have, since ancient times, made the Moon an important cultural influence on language, calendars,
                        art, and mythology.
